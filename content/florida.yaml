    body: "<p>Florida condo insurance (also called HO6 or condominium insurance) is a necessary safeguard for the contents in your home. It picks up where your HOA policy leaves off to protect your walls, furnishings, belongings, liability, and more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"findingcondoinsuranceinflorida\">Finding Condo Insurance in Florida</h2>\n<p>If you’re a homeowner living in a condo in Florida, you need <a href=\"/condo-insurance/\">condo insurance</a> (<a href=\"/glossary/ho6-policy/\">HO6 insurance</a>) to fill the gaps the homeowners association policy won’t cover. Good news for condo owners in the Sunshine State: it’s super easy to get condo insurance from Kin. We cover all types of condos – even those you own and rent out on home-share sites like Airbnb.</p>\n<p>We cover condo owners of all kinds, including those who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Live in a townhouse, row house, or high rise.</li>\n<li>Use the condo as a primary residence, seasonal residence, or for short-term renting.</li>\n<li>Have a condo owned by an LLC or trust.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because condo insurance for Florida homeowners doesn’t have to cover the entire structure of your place, it’s surprisingly affordable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"floridacondoinsurancediscountsdiscounts\">Florida Condo Insurance Discounts {#discounts}</h2>\n<p>To help you save even more on your condo insurance in Florida, we’ll check to see if you qualify for discounts. For example, we can offer discounts for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strong wind mitigation features.</li>\n<li>Fire protective devices.</li>\n<li>Being a mature condo owner.</li>\n<li>Choosing the <a href=\"/faq/responsible-repair-discount/\">Responsible Repair</a> discount (i.e., agreeing to not sign away your claims benefits to a third party).</li>\n<li>Signing up for an electronic policy. (Save some trees!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can also recommend the deductibles that make sense for your budget. Typically, choosing slightly higher deductibles can reduce your condo insurance in Florida costs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesfloridacondoinsurancecovercover\">What Does Florida Condo Insurance Cover? {#cover}</h2>\n<p>Your homeowners association has a “master” insurance policy (sometimes called <a href=\"/glossary/hoa-insurance/\">HOA insurance</a>) to cover your building’s exterior and damage and accidents in common areas. But that policy doesn’t cover anything inside your unit. You need Florida HO6 insurance for that.</p>\n<p>Condo insurance covers your home from the walls in. That includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The inside of</strong> <strong>your condo.</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-a/\">Dwelling coverage</a> can help pay to repair or replace damaged ceilings, floors, additions, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Your personal property.</strong> This is where your policy really shines! <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-c/\">Personal property insurance</a> typically protects your furniture, appliances, clothing, electronics, decor, furnishings, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Loss of use.</strong> If a covered Florida HO6 insurance claim forces you to temporarily relocate, <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-d/\">loss of use coverage</a> can help pay for dining out, hotel stays, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal liability.</strong> If someone is hurt in your home and they sue, the <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-e/\">personal liability coverage</a> in your policy can help.</li>\n<li><strong>Medical payments.</strong> <a href=\"/home-insurance/coverage-f/\">Medical payments coverage</a> can help with immediate medical expenses for guests who experience injuries in your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our Florida condo insurance covers damage from all incidents except those explicitly excluded in your policy. So if the inside of your condo is damaged by fire, theft, vandalism, storm winds, or hail, you’re typically covered.</p>\n<p>Standard HO6 insurance in Florida usually doesn’t cover damage from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Earthquakes and mudslides.</li>\n<li>Flood damage (though you can always add on <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood coverage</a>).</li>\n<li>Demolition or seizure by the government.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"islossassessmentcoverageincludedinfloridacondoinsuranceloss\">Is Loss Assessment Coverage Included in Florida Condo Insurance? {#loss}</h2>\n<p>All our condo insurance policies include $2,000 in <a href=\"/condo-insurance/loss-assessment-coverage/\">loss assessment coverage</a>. This can help pay for your HOA’s assessments for shared losses, stepping in when those losses are caused by incidents your condo policy covers and potentially saving you thousands of dollars that would otherwise come out of your pocket.</p>\n<p>You can always add on more loss assessment protection, too.</p>\n<p>{{<pros-cons-wrapper>}}\n{{%pros heading=\"What's Covered?\" %}}</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage</li>\n<li>Unit’s interior from the walls in</li>\n<li>Personal property</li>\n<li>Loss of use</li>\n<li>Personal liability coverage</li>\n<li>Guest medical payments</li>\n<li>Perils</li>\n<li>All of them except for those excluded</li>\n<li>People</li>\n<li>Condo unit owners</li>\n<li>Structures</li>\n<li>Townhouses</li>\n<li>Row houses</li>\n<li>Highrises</li>\n<li>Occupancy</li>\n<li>Primary residence</li>\n<li>Secondary residence</li>\n<li>Short-term rental\n{{%/pros%}}\n{{%cons heading=\"What’s Not?\" %}}</li>\n<li>Coverage</li>\n<li>Building’s exterior</li>\n<li>Other structures</li>\n<li>Common areas</li>\n<li>Perils</li>\n<li>Earthquakes</li>\n<li>Floods</li>\n<li>Demolition to bring the home up to code</li>\n<li>Seizure or demolition by the government</li>\n<li>People</li>\n<li>Condo building owners</li>\n<li>Structures</li>\n<li>Single-family detached homes</li>\n<li>Mobile homes</li>\n<li>Occupancy</li>\n<li>Vacant year round\n{{%/pros%}}\n{{</pros-cons-wrapper>}}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchfloridacondoinsurancedoineedneed\">How Much Florida Condo Insurance Do I Need? {#need}</h2>\n<p>We can help you figure out how much Florida condo insurance makes sense for your needs. There’s no “right” answer here – your insurance coverage needs vary based on your lifestyle and the kind of items you have.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have a condo full of antiques and high-value art, it might make sense for you to have more personal property coverage than general guidelines tend to recommend.</p>\n<p>That said, the chart below illustrates some general suggestions for choosing your Florida HO6 insurance coverage limits.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Your condo’s homeowners association may have specific Florida condo insurance requirements, so be sure to check your bylaws before you buy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"commonfloridacondocoveragelimits\">Common Florida Condo Coverage Limits</h3>\n<p>| Type of Coverage | Typical Limits |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dwelling | Up to the replacement cost of the interior (we calculate this for you) |\n| Personal property | 20% to 50% of the coverage you have for your dwelling |\n| Loss of use | 20% of the coverage you have for your dwelling |\n| Personal liability | $100,000 |\n| Medical payments | $1,000 |</p>\n<h2 id=\"floridacondoinsurancequotesonline\">Florida Condo Insurance Quotes Online</h2>\n<p>How much is condo insurance in Florida?
